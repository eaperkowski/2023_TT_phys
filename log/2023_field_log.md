# Log file for 2023 field campaign at Trillium Trail in Pittsburgh, PA

## April 13, 2023
Field logs created and printed off (see `licor_log_file_blank.xlsx`). Five LI-6800s, one consumable pelican case, and one LI-2200 plant canopy analyzer are all packed and ready to go. All ancillary consumables (desiccant, soda lime, baking sheets and mitts for desiccant recharging) are packed.

Brief field day at Trillium Trail (tour and background from Susan). No measurements collected, but plot layout and general sampling approach made apparent for measurement collection to begin. Tons of Trillium apparent in plots with large enough leaves to measure gas exchange with. Anticipated measurement collection start date is tomorrow, although wintry mix/snow is expected overnight in the region. Might need to start field campaign later in day to allow snowmelt (high temperatures in lower 50s as day progresses).

Attempted to do field work, but it was too cold for the Licors to pass H2O warmup tests. Chatted with Nick over protocol, decided on single A/Ci curve per individual followed by a fluorescence measurement. No need for a light response curve. Planning on starting first field campaign tomorrow.

Plot 3 finished and cross referenced with Jessie's demography data. Made decision to not measure tags with multiple rhizomes (i.e. "twins"). Instead, decided to do an a priori randomization where all individuals on the northwest side (away from road, looking uphill, rhizome furthest uphill and to the left) were measured. I fear response curves with multiple rhizomes will cause pseudoreplication issues due to their nonindependence. E-mailed Lalasia to see what was done for the EcoLetters paper in 2021.

Plot 4 is a bit of a mess to get through due to heavy precipitation pooling along bottom of plot. It is advised that this plot not be visited after periods of rainfall. In fact, plots are not safe for anyone to traverse plots alone, at least one accompanying person is likely required to maintain safety.

No fluorescence measurements were recorded (unreconcilable issues in the field with an error message explaining that FLR measurements were not on), but a conversation between Kelly and Evan led to the decision to bring along the multispeQ for subsequent trips to estimate phiPS2 for carbon budget calculations. Kelly will bring the multispeQ to fly up to Evan after he comes back from Vienna.

Plot 5 finished and cross referenced with Jessie's demography data. Many Trillium apparent in this plot, though access to some is limited by a recent tree that fell through the plot. Was able to finish about 40 curves in a day- not bad for two Licors. Noticing rapid time to acclimate to cuvette conditions in morning hours (~9-11am) that gradually get longer as the day goes on. I wonder if this is driven by fact that slope faces sunrise in the morning, so plants are acclimated to morning light conditions. 

Correspondence from both Mason (visited plots today) and Lalasia (e-mail) support plan to only record a response curve for one stem per 'individual'. Selected stem is recorded in log file to aid in replicating stems across growing season.

## April 21, 2023
Plot 7 finished and cross referenced with Jessie's demography data. Less Trillium apparent in plot, plot seems to be dominated by Maianthemum and Arisaema (at least focal tagged individuals). Sample effort for plot should increase with later emergence of Mai and Ari. Quick acclimation times in cuvette during morning hours, as observed in plot 5.

No data collection; rainy day and prep for return to Lubbock/EGU.

## May 04, 2023
Finally made it out to field after a week of rain. Trails are slick and not safe for traversing with Licors. Spoke with Nick on phone and we discussed only doing 3 plots (3, 5, 7) due to tons of Trillium replication across plots. Made decision to move on to Maianthemum for the same plots (similar sampling effort required to finish plots) for next two days as they are fully expanded and the upper canopy is about to close.

## May 05, 2023
Made it out to plot 5 successfully with Licors. Less abundant Maianthemum in this plot, so opting to finish plot and collect Multispeq data before moving on to plot 3. Plot 3 also finished today, as rain is in forecast for Sunday. Pushing to finish Maianthemum tomorrow at plot 7 for ~80 Maianthemum curves spread across two days. Some issues with Stan on retaining VPD between curves (humid day)

## May 06, 2023
Finished plot 7 with ~36 curves. Sunny day. Made some decisions about not doing curves that were directly underneath maple and beech seedlings. Plot 7 has interesting secondary sub-canopy with seedlings where leaves are fully expanded, mimicking open canopy of upper canopy space. Made note of some individuals that were measured under seedlings (~3 individuals) as I suspect these may need to be removed during analyses. Full plot finished today (~40 curves) and Maianthemum is totally finished before the canopy closed!
